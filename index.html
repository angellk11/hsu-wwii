        <h2 class="title">Fallen Reddies of World War II</h2>
        <p>Reddies served in every corner of the globe during World War II, from Europe and North Africa to India,
            Alaska, the South Pacific, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic. These are the names of those known to have
            died in the war—and of one who lived to fight another day. Among these men are the first professional
            baseball player and the first chaplain from Arkansas to die in WWII. During the conflict, Henderson
            president Matt Locke Ellis personally wrote letters to console those parents whose sons were killed and to
            encourage those whose sons were reported missing or injured. Some of the information below comes from those
            letters and from a draft of a speech he likely gave at the dedication of memorial holly trees along
            Huddleston Street (since removed). If you know of a Reddie—student, faculty, or staff member—who died in
            WWII and is not listed here, please contact the library. Corrections or additional details would also be
            especially appreciated.

                            B-25D "Mexican Spitfire"</a>. He took off from Biak Island, Biak Numfor Regency, Papua
                        Province, Indonesia on a mission over Langoan Airfield, Sulawesi, Indonesia. They were later
                        diverted to strafe Japanese soldiers near Lahbeh Strait, Indonesia. During the mission they were
                        hit by ground anti-aircraft fire which damaged their B-25 enough that they had to ditch into the
                        Lahbeh Strait. On impact, the nose submerged, forcing the tail and right wing to break off. A
                        Japanese Zero strafed the crew as they were escaping, but was driven away by other B-25s from
                        the squadron circling to protect them. All five crew were observed in the water before their
                        plane sank five minutes later. Their raft seemed damaged and only partially inflated. Short on
                        fuel, the other B-25s departed and no trace of the crew was ever seen again. Lloyd was
                        officially declared Missing in Action during the war. He was awarded the Air Medal and the
                        Purple Heart.</p>

                    <p>Lt. Citty entered Henderson in 1938. By 1940, he had completed two years of college and was
                        working as a driver while living at home. He enlisted in the army on December 21, 1940 when his
                        Arkansas National Guard unit was federalized. It became the 153rd Infantry Regiment which was
                        stationed in Alaska. While there he reached the rank of Staff Sergeant. Citty was picked to
                        attend Officers Candidate School and became a Lieutenant in January 1943. That same month he
                        married Christine Phillips. He became a member of the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment. The 325th
                        first saw action when they were sent to Salerno in September 15, 1943, arriving in landing
                        crafts, not gliders, to reinforce Rangers who had landed a week earlier. Lt. Citty was killed on
                        September 24, 1943 as the Allies advanced toward the Volturno River. He was only officer from
                        his regiment killed in action in Italy.</p>

                        enrolled at the Henderson State Teachers College and received a degree. He entered the Army Air
                        Corps on December 3, 1941, four days before the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor. He received his
                        basic training at Maxwell Field, Alabama, and attended Gunnery School at Ft. Myers, Florida, and
                        navigator's school at Selman Field, Louisiana. He qualified as expert in air gunnery and
                        received his gunnery wings, navigator's wings aerial observer’s wings. Gilbert was assigned to a
                        B-17 in the 301st Bomb Group, 352nd Squadron, 15th Air Force and departed the United States for
                        Africa on October 6, 1943. He participated in 35 missions during the African and Italian
                        campaigns to include bombing runs on the German oil fields at Polesti, Romania. He also was in
                        raids over Austria and Germany. Due to his expertise, Gilbert was chosen as navigator for Major
                        Jimmie Doolittle on a special flight through Italy and North Africa in December, 1943. Gilbert
                        was killed in action over Regensburg, Germany during a bombing run on February 25, 1944, when
                        his bomber was shot down. His bomb group received a second Presidential Unit Citation for this
                        mission due to the intense and vicious battle the group had with enemy fighters over Germany.
                        His body was buried in Germany then repatriated after the war and returned to his parents for
                        burial in Arkansas.</p>

                    <p>Cpt. McKnight was the 6th child of Byron McKnight and his wife Viola Suddath in Lincoln County,
                        Missouri. He was one of four brothers serving during World War II. He was awarded the Silver
                        Star for heroism during the Novaliches-Balara action, the Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart. The
                        Rev. and Mrs B.A. McKnight received a telegram from the War Department on February 27th, 1945
                        stating that their son was killed in action on Luzon. McKnight, a Methodist chaplain, had been
                        overseas for 21 months. He received an A.B. degree from Henderson-Brown College, and a B.D. at
                        Southern Methodist in May 1942, and entered the Army as a chaplain the day following graduation.
                        McKnight is believed to be the first Methodist chaplain from Arkansas to pay the supreme
                        sacrifice. He was survived by his widow, Fern Jacqueline Nichols, and 12 year old daughter
                        Carolyn. </p>

                    <p>On August 26, 1944 in the vicinity of St. Vallier, Lt. Ben Rogers of the 4th platoon led a patrol
                        to a house and captured 6 Germans. Rogers and the 442nd Regiment, composed largely of Nisei
                        soldiers, was later moved to the Vosges Forest region in eastern France. There they faced the
                        Germans who were fighting with superhuman effort with their backs against the German border.
                        After liberating the French town of Bruyères on October 18, 1944, the regiment was then called
                        upon to rescue the "Lost Battalion", as they suffered decimating casualties in the wintry cold
                        rain and snow. Lt. Rogers. was killed in action in the Vosges Mountain-St Die Campaign on
                        November 14, 1944, during the campaign that eventually liberated the Lost Battalion. Franz
                        Steidl, in his book Lost Battalion, notes that on November 14, 1944, a German self-propelled 88
                        scored a hit on the 3rd Battalion Command Post killing Lt. Ben W. Rogers, Jr. and wounding Dave
                        Kawagoye, Masao Hayakawa and Masao Aizawa. Rogers was remembered by Anti-Tanker Hany Yoshimura
                        as "a cowboy from Little Rock, Arkansas". He was awarded the Bronze Star Arrowhead, Purple Heart
                        and Combat Infantryman Badge. The Bronze Star Arrowhead designates participation in a combat
                        glider landing</p>

                    <p>Lt. Wafford entered Henderson on September 8, 1937, and received the B.A. degree on May 30, 1941.
                        He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Reserve upon the completion of the four-year
                        R.O.T.C. course at Henderson. Lt. Wafford transferred to the Army Air Corps and received his
                        wings at Columbus, Mississippi, Army Air Field on Labor Day, 1942. He went overseas in late
                        January, 1943, and was killed in India on February 24, 1943. He had not at that time gone into
                        combat duty, and it is presumed that he was killed by strafing after the Japanese bombed the
                        field where he was stationed. Lt. Wafford wes a member of the Baptist Church.</p>
